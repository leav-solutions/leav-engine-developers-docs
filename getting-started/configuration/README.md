# ðŸ’… Configuration

Each service has its own JavaScript configuration files.

Default configuration can be overridden in 2 ways:

* Providing a `local.js` file in service config folder.\
  Settings specified in this file will override default ones (more info [here](https://github.com/leav-solutions/leav-engine/tree/master/libs/config-manager)).
* Setting environment variables at runtime
